Will add a box to your backend edit pages to insert image credits. A shortcode will show all image credits, sorted by their origin site.

== Description ==

Do you use stock photos from big stock photo sites such as Fotolia, istockphoto or 123rf on your site? Then you probably need to include the image credits / author credits with each photo to avoid legal issues.

When searching a lightweight solution for this, you might have stumbled upon complex plugins.

Our approach was to keep this plugin **as lightweight and simple as possible** - to make sure every one of your wordpress contributors will understand how to use the plugin.

* Our plugin simply adds a textbox below the text editor.
* You can then use the shortcode [image_credits] to let Wordpress show the full list of image credits, separated by the URL where the images are being used. Many webmasters choose to show the image credits on their imprint site, others create separate pages for it.

If you have any suggestions or questions, just ask. We will continue to update this plugin, while keeping it simple and as easy to use as possible.

== Installation ==

1. Install Plugin
2. Add your own image credit notes to the new box in your page/post-edit sites in backend.
3. Insert shortcode [image_credits] wherever you like to show image credits.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Is there an option to translate the plugin?
Right now, the only text that the plugin displays appears in the Wordpress backend. Therefore, we haven't included any translations yet. The user will only see the list of your image credits.

== Screenshots ==

1. In backend, our plugin will automatically add a box below the text editor on all page- or post-edit pages. There you'll be able to insert any image credit information.
2. The shortcode [image_credits] will output all image credits in one consolidated list - ideal for a separate page or for your imprint page.
3. The way [image_credits] looks for users.
